# Hashing-and-search-for-vectors-and-polygonal-curves
The present project implements:
 
**A**. The LSH algorithm for vectors on d-dimensional space based on the Manhatan metric (L1), as well as, the Hypercube algorithm based on the same metric. Having as input a vector q, the program returns:
 * The nearest neighbour of q 
 * All vectors at distance R from q

**B**. The LSH and Hypercube algorithms for polygonal curves. Having as input a polygonal curve q, the program finds its nearest neighbour. It supports the Dynamic Time Wrapping for calculating the distance between two polygonal curves.

**Notes**:
